1. Complement in Binary number system
    -> unsigned number
    -> signed number (0 means +, 1 means -)
    -> MSB, LSB

2. Floating point number conversions
    -> decimal 34.625 to Binary
    -> Binary 1010.1111 to decimal

3. Storage units
    Nibble   | Half a Byte    | 4 bits
    Byte     | 8 bits         | 1 Byte
    KiloByte | 1024 Bytes     | 1 KB
    MegaByte | 1024 KiloBytes | 1 MB
    GigaByte | 1024 MegaBytes | 1 GB
    TeraByte | 1024 GigaBytes | 1 TB

4. How many bits do I need to store decimal 17?

5. Given 4 bits, what are the minimum and maximum number you can store?

6. Given 8 bits, what are the minimum and maximum number you can store?

7. Biggest Binary Number given n?

8. Applications of Binary Numbers 
    -> ASCII
    -> IP Address

0100 0011 - C
0100 1111 - O
0100 0100 - D
0100 0101 - E

IEEE 754
If you get 0.3 when you add 0.2 + 0.1 , You have a supercomputer.
